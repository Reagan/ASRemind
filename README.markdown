ASRemind
=========

AS Remind is a minimal desktop application written in Java (read:widget) that links up with your entries on Google Calendar and informs you when an activity is coming up. In addition, it also allows you to make simple notes on the activities that you are doing on the track section of the application. This application/widget potrays the use of Java Swing to create desktop applications.

Please note that this is an alpha version of this application and that not all features may work as expected. Please send me an email on *reaganmbitiru@gmail.com* in case of this. The application has been tested on Windows7 & Xubuntu 11.10.
