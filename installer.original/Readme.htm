	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>AS Remind is a minimal desktop application written in Java (read:widget) that links up with your entries on Google Calendar and informs you when an activity is coming up. In addition, it also allows you to make simple notes on the activities that you are doing on the track section of the application.</p>
	<h4>Installation</h4>
	<p>To install AS Remind, select the install.exe file and select various options in the installation process. </p>
	<h4>Support</h4>
	<p>This alpha version of this application is offered free (as in "free speech" not as "free beer") and continous development will be provided. However, please feel free to contact the developer at <reaganmbitiru@gmail.com> if you have any issues and I promise to get back to you as soon as possible!</p>
